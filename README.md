## üìù Description
**Apocalypse Simulator** is an interactive question-and-action game where your choices affect your stats.

**This Backend** is the server that powers the **Apocalypse Simulator**, an interactive decision-making game. The backend is built with **Spring Boot** and handles the game logic, user authentication via **OAuth2 with Google**, and the persistent storage of data regarding characters, events, and their effects on the character stats.

This backend also interacts with a **PostgreSQL** database (hosted on **Supabase**), though it can be easily configured to work with any other database.

### üö® Backend Information (Render Deployment)
The backend of this project is deployed on **Render** and may enter **sleep mode** after a period of inactivity. The first request after the backend is in sleep mode may take a few moments to start up.

#### Please be patient while it initializes.

## ‚ö° Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports **OAuth2** with Google to sign in and manage profiles.
- **Character Management**: Stores the information of created characters, their stats, and their progress.
- **Events**: Manages game events (questions and decisions) and their effects on character stats.
- **Database**: Uses **PostgreSQL** (on **Supabase**, but easily configurable for other providers).
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for the frontend to interact with the game and users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with Google
- **API**: RESTful APIs with **Spring Data JPA**
- **Email**: Integration with **SMTP** (e.g., Gmail)
- **Containerization**: Docker

## üìÇ Installation and Configuration

### üîß Prerequisites
- **Java 21** or higher
- **Maven** (or another build tool)
- **PostgreSQL Database** (can be replaced with another database)
- **Google OAuth2 Credentials** for user authentication

### üì• Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gorocode/as-spring-boot.git
   cd as-spring-boot
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables:
   Create an `.env` file (or use `application.properties` or `application.yml`) at the root of the project with the following variables:
   ```env
   FRONTEND_URL=<YOUR_FRONTEND_URL>
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>
   SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
   SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
   SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR_EMAIL>
   SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The server will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Database Configuration
The project is set up to use **PostgreSQL**, but you can change the configurations in `application.properties` and the driver in `pom.xml` to connect to any other database supported by JPA. 


### üõ†Ô∏è Docker Deployment
This project is configured for deployment using **Docker**. The `Dockerfile` allows building and running the application in an isolated environment.

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t apocalypse-simulator-backend .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 apocalypse-simulator-backend
   ```

   The application will run on port `8080` within the container.
